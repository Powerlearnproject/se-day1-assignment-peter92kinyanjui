Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is process of developing high quality systems such as websites and applications through application of engineering principles, methods and tools such IDEs. This entails developing robust, scalable and flexible software applications. It is important in the technology industry because it helps develop solutions for businesses such as predictive models, websites, ecommerce platforms among others to sell products, educate, social apps among others.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Invention of digital computers were invented and programming as practice was born
Software engineering become a vital branch in computer technology with growth of development languages
New methods and platforms such as IDE were developed for coding, testing and deployment before putting software in production environment
Great figures also made the vice popular by developing new innovations that skyrocketed software engineering  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gathering - process of gathering needed functions and quality standards
Development - process of actual coding and development of modules
Testing - process of measuring against standards desired and evaluation of functions
Deployment - launching the developed product into the production environment
Implementation - launching the for use to intended users 
Maintenance - Maintaining and debugging 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a method of software development cycle is sequential where a product is developed fully then launched. Most appropriate for a product that does not require much user input and overall outcomes are clearly known
Agile method is iterative with repeated cycles after every module is developed then tested
Scrum involves in short time of development cycles called sprints. Most ideal for products whose outcomes are not clearly known and requires stakeholders input at various stages of development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer does the actual coding of the programs
Quality Assurance Engineer oversees that the program meets required standards and functionalities 
Project manager ensures the project is developed and launched in the set time, within budget and acts as intermediary between various stakeholders

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important as they provide a platform for writing code, debugging and testing before implementation such visual code
version control systems such as GitHub helps with monitoring versions of the various development phases 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Failure to meet timelines due to underestimated scope, overcome by creating necessary allowances and determining clear milestones
changing scope of work with additional functions being added by users.
Budget limitations that can be moderated by controlling outcomes required and application of best industry practices

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing checks that a given functional unit is working as desired and giving the required outcome
integration testing checks that all units of the systems are working well and coordinating as desired
System testing is when all units are all working well with good coordination for a fully functional system outcome
Acceptance testing checks that it aligns well with the users and all are okay with using the system

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to writing prompts in clear, concise, specific manner to get the most accurate output desired. This is important to ensure the AI instruments are getting correct instructions to easily process accurate output

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Write a summary of income levels of households in Kenya
Clear prompt: Write a summary analysis of income levels of households with individuals earning a salary range between 20,0000 and 1,000,000
